The Intelligent Prescriptive Energy Management System (iP-EMS) is an advanced Cyber-Physical System (CPS) that successfully integrates a high-fidelity Random Forest Regressor for load forecasting (R² = 0.966) with a real-time Digital Twin (DT) to enable autonomous, closed-loop control. This system's primary innovation is the formalized Health Score (Hⱼ) which drives the Prescriptive Command Policy (Πⱼ), allowing the system to autonomously issue safety-critical SHUTDOWN commands (for Hⱼ < 70%) and strategic OPTIMIZE commands (for 70% ≤ Hⱼ < 85%). Crucially, the iP-EMS utilizes an Asynchronous WebSocket protocol to achieve zero-latency synchronization (τ_comm ≈ 0), eliminating communication delays and validating the architecture's feasibility for real-time risk-aware control in next-generation smart factories.
